# MarketingResponse
This project is based on the Kaggle competition Springleaf Marketing Response: https://www.kaggle.com/c/springleaf-marketing-response

The objective of this competition is to predict which customers are likely to respond to a direct mail offer.

I chose to work on this problem because the original dataset consists of 1932 feature variables. Therefore, good feature selection will be a crucial part of the overall solution.
